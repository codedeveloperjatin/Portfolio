## About Me

### I have tried different web technologies like Gatsby , Flutter , Godot Game Engine , React and WordPress. 
I have found that using frameworks and bundles to develop a web application or a game is much faster than starting
everything from scratch, I am a big believer of the lego system in building a web application, every client is hard pressed 
on time and the best practice in my opinion is to combine the best tools in the industry and make something which is the sum total of all the awesome 
parts.
